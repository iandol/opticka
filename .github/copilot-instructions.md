# Copilot instructions for Opticka (MATLAB/PTB)

Copilot should follow the repository-wide agent guide:

- **Primary instructions:** `../AGENTS.md`

Notes:
- Keep this file minimal; do not duplicate the full project conventions here.
- If Copilot-specific quirks are needed later, add them below and keep `AGENTS.md`
  as the single source of truth.
