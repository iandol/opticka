The dots are constructed in 3 sets% that are plotted in sequence.  For each set, the probability that% a dot is replotted in motion -- as opposed to randomly replaced --% is given by the dotInfo.coh value.  This routine generates a set of% dots as an ndots_ by 2 matrix of locations, and sends this to DOTS for% plotting is DrawMethod is set to MEX or to a Matlab loop in RUSH mode of% psychtoolbox if DrawMethod is set to RUSH.  In plotting the next set of% dots (e.g., set 2) it prepends the preceding set (e.g., set 1).% Since DOTS writes in XOR mode, replotting the old set erases it to its% previous value, whether that be background or fixation point, etc.%% created by MKMK July 2006, based on ShadlenDots by MNS, JIG and others% structures are not altered in this function, so should not have memory% problems from matlab creating new structures...mfilenameif nargin < 3    targets.x = [];endcurWindow = screenInfo.curWindow;dotColor = dotInfo.dotColor;rseed = screenInfo.rseed;waitpress = 0; % 1 means wait for a mouse press, 0 means wait for releaseif isfield(dotInfo, 'keys')    keys = dotInfo.keys;else    keys = [];endif isfield(dotInfo, 'mouse')    mouse = dotInfo.mouse;else    mouse = [];endstart_time = NaN;end_time= NaN;response = {NaN, NaN};response_time = NaN;% SEED THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR ... if "[]" is given, reset% the seed "randomly"... this is for VAR/NOVAR conditionsif ~isempty(rseed) && length(rseed) == 1    rand('state', rseed);elseif ~isempty(rseed) && length(rseed) == 2    rand('state', rseed(1)*rseed(2));else    rseed = sum(100*clock);    rand('state', rseed);end% USEFUL LOCAL VARS% variables that are sent to rex have been multiplied by a factor of 10 to% make sure they are integers.
